                <span class="pastors"> The Bible makes it clear that simply living in this world, we will have trouble. Sometimes we bring suffering on ourselves, sometimes others inflict it on us, and sometimes difficulties arise based on circumstances of life. However, in the midst of the affliction, trouble, or suffering – whether it’s emotional, financial, relational, or circumstantial – you will need comfort. God is our ultimate comforter. While affliction is unavoidable, there is no hardship for which God cannot and will not supply adequate comfort. And, as we experience His comfort in a tangible way, we are instructed to comfort one another.</span>

                <div class="blogonetitle">Good Samaritan</div>
                <div class="blogonecontent">The parable of Good Samaritan is usually spoken in the context of helping the helpless. It inspires us to support the people who are disadvantaged physically, mentally or financially. This parable, like the others in the bible has a deeper spiritual meaning. We would focus on the deeper meaning of the latter part of the parable, which talks about the man being stripped of his raiment.

                    It is also important to understand the context behind the parable that Jesus was referring. In Luke 10:25 (KJV), it says a certain lawyer asked Jesus on how to inherit eternal life. The intention behind the question was malicious. The Pharisees were constantly looking out to ensnare Jesus by asking him questions to elicit answers that could either be blasphemous or rebellious to the Roman Empire ruling Israel, as any one of these could amount to death penalty. They wanted to discredit Jesus’ new teachings and miracles which had been received gladly by the common Jews during that time.</div>
