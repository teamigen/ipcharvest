                <div class="blogonetitle">Good Samaritan</div>
                <div class="blogonecontent">The parable of Good Samaritan is usually spoken in the context of helping the helpless. It inspires us to support the people who are disadvantaged physically, mentally or financially. This parable, like the others in the bible has a deeper spiritual meaning. We would focus on the deeper meaning of the latter part of the parable, which talks about the man being stripped of his raiment.

                    It is also important to understand the context behind the parable that Jesus was referring. In Luke 10:25 (KJV), it says a certain lawyer asked Jesus on how to inherit eternal life. The intention behind the question was malicious. The Pharisees were constantly looking out to ensnare Jesus by asking him questions to elicit answers that could either be blasphemous or rebellious to the Roman Empire ruling Israel, as any one of these could amount to death penalty. They wanted to discredit Jesus’ new teachings and miracles which had been received gladly by the common Jews during that time.</div>
